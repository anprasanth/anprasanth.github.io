# Warehouse inventory management 

<img src="/images/aims-overview.png" alt="System overview" width="750">

This is work I directed at Sientis (a Nokia venture). Warehouses perform inventory cycle counting manually
which is slow and costly. We developed indoor drones which fly autonomously and capture images of inventory 
locations performing inventory counting 30x faster. The drones used in-house computer vision localization 
without requiring any additional infrastructure (such as beacons or tags).

We built an industry-leading compact and quiet drone that can navigate narrow aisles and captures 4K images.
The images are uploaded to the on-premise edge server and public cloud where the images are processed and
the inventory results are presented.
