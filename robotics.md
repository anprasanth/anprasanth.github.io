# Warehouse inventory management 

<img src="/images/aims-overview.png" alt="System overview" width="750">

This is work I directed at Sientis (a Nokia venture). Warehouses perform inventory cycle counting manually
which is slow and costly. We developed indoor drones which fly autonomously and capture images of inventory 
locations performing inventory counting 30x faster. The drones use in-house computer vision localization 
without requiring any additional infrastructure (such as beacons or tags).

We built an industry-leading compact and quiet drone that can navigate narrow aisles and captures 4K images.
The images are uploaded to the on-premise edge server and public cloud where the images are processed and
the inventory results are presented to the warehouse user.

# Plant monitoring in vertical farms

This is work I directed at Nokia Bell Labs, where we collaborated with AeroFarms. In indoor vertical farms, 
the plants go through a growth cycle of few weeks during which they need to be inspected every day by
plant scientists, which is time-consuming and thus costly. We developed indoor drones which fly autonomously
and capture high-resolution images of every plant tray. The drones use computer vision localization with 
Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) and drift correction using fiducials. The images are uploaded to the on-premise 
edge server where the images are processed and the plant analytics results are presented to the plant scientists.
